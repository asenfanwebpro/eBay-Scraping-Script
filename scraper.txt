1) Scrape Google/Yelp Business for medical clinics 
2) Then we publish each business profile on our website similar to links above just like how like bird eye does 
3) Setup cron, so scrapes Google/Yelp page and updates their profile monthly 


I have summarized it for you.Project is to do exactly what Bird Eye is doing.

As you can see, their algorithm searches Google Places for "Medical Practices" and automatically creates a unique page for them. Then they aggregate all the Google/Yelp/FB reviws and posts it on their public page 

How do you plan on handling monthly checks on google and yelp so that the new reviews get posted on the public page?
I think google has a limit of how many crawls

I want you to predict the challenges and obstacles so you can work around it.

In your demo, we need to see how you plan on how system will automatically create a unique URL for the profile page on the server for the "Endodontic" dental clinic business based on google places. Just like how Bird eye does. Then aggregate the google reviews/yelp/fb reviews for it on the profile page.
