Your system should automatically create a business profile page  showing their google/fb/yelp reviews on one page. Since there will be 1000+ businesses, there will be 1000+ individual pages which help with google ranking

For instance, the system has automatically generated a business profile page like https://birdeye.com/advanced-endodontics-601695872   just for Advanced Endodontics

Just like Birdeye, their algorithm searches Google Places and then creates an individual profile page for their business. They then aggregate all google reviews/yelp reviews/fb reviews and put it in that individual profile page.

This is only for "Endodontic" Dental Practices. Google Places that designate "Endodontics" as their industry

Should be just like Birdeye
